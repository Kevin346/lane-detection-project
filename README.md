# lane-detection-project
This readme file serves to present a summary of why and what this progam does
for readers who happen upon this. Along with additional info to what the 
source code must have for references.

Overall this program is able to detect solid lanes upon a road and 
presents a visual indication that this is true.The purpose of me 
writing this program is to simply practice python and deep learning
subjects in the field of computer science. I may come back to this 
project to further refine the code especially given that the one 
issue i have with this program is that it does not tolerate dashed lines.
As of now, i have yet taken any huge steps accomplishing this and am 
currently researching a solution. For now I feel as if this program is 
solid enough to display in my first pieces of work within github.

Necessary materials for this would be standard python3, openCV, and numpy
